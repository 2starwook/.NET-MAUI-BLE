# Stethoscope Audio Recorder Project
The project used .NET Maui and C# to develop a high-quality cross-platform app with an MVVM architecture, REST APIs, audio functionality, visualization, and data management.

## Description
The project was built using the .NET Maui framework and the C# programming language, which provided a strong foundation for developing a cross-platform (Android, iOS, Mac, and Windows) application. The application architecture followed the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, allowing for clear separation of concerns and facilitating maintainability and scalability. Wireless communication was achieved using REST APIs over Wi-Fi, enabling data transfer between the application and external hardware. For audio-related functionality, the application used the Plugin.Maui.Audio library to enable audio playback. Additionally, SkiaSharp (2D Graphics library) was utilized for audio visualization, implementing the Root Mean Square (RMS) method to create visual representations of audio data. The application also used a robust database solution using MongoDB Realm, providing a flexible and scalable environment for data storage and retrieval. This combination of technologies and methodologies ensured the development of a high-quality application that met the project requirements.

## Future Work
- Transitioning wireless communication from Wi-Fi to Bluetooth
- Additional audio visualization options and data analysis features
- user interface (UI) adjustment for a broader range of devices across multiple platforms
